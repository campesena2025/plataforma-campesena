# Hooks Directory

Custom React hooks for the application.

## Purpose

Store reusable custom hooks that:
- Abstract complex logic
- Handle common state management patterns
- Manage side effects
- Interface with external services

## Best Practices

- Name hooks with 'use' prefix (e.g., useAuth, useForm)
- Keep hooks focused on a single responsibility
- Document hook parameters and return values
- Include TypeScript types for parameters and return values
