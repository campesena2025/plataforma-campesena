# Components Directory

Contains all React components, organized by their scope and purpose.

## Structure

- `/common` - Reusable UI components (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.)
- `/layout` - Layout components (headers, footers, navigation, etc.)
- `/specific` - Feature-specific components that are not meant to be reused across different features

## Best Practices

- Keep components small and focused
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Include prop validation
- Write components using functional components and hooks
