# Services Directory

Contains all service layer implementations following Clean Architecture principles.

## Structure

- `/api` - API client implementations and request handlers
- Core business logic implementations
- Service interfaces
- Data transformation layer

## Best Practices

- Keep services focused on business logic
- Implement proper error handling
- Use TypeScript interfaces for service definitions
- Keep services independent of UI layer
